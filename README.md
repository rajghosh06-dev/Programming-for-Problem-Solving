This repository contains all the programming assignments, lab exercises, and practice problems from my **B.Tech 1st Year (CSE - AI&ML)** curriculum at Geethanjali College of Engineering and Technology. It is divided into two semesters:

- **PPS1 (Semester 1)** – Fundamentals of C Programming  
- **PPS2 (Semester 2)** – Advanced C Concepts and Problem Solving

Whether you're a fellow student, educator, or curious learner, this repo aims to provide a clear, well-documented reference for foundational programming concepts using C.
